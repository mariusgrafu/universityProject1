## University Project
This is a project I've made for a course I've attended. I had to include a bunch of features that were presented in class by that point. Meant to be a website for the video game [Red Dead Redemption 2](https://www.rockstargames.com/reddeadredemption2/).
Made with HTML, Javascript and SCSS.
